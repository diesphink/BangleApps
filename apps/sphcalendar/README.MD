# SPH Calendar

Simple calendar with a vintage menu style

**Motivation**

I wanted to click on the date at the clock and see the calendar, so there it is. The visual style is based on my clock design.

**Features**

- Localization via Languages app
- Can go forward or back on months by clicking on the lines at the side of the month name
- Click on calendar to close
- On lock, returns to clock

**TODO**

Both the icons are still placeholders, I'll make a new icon that combines with the theme better (probl'y after making a new launcher, :P)
